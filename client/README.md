## Ionic Project Structure

## Connect Ionic with Firebase

## Ionic Cordova Integration

With the following command Cordova will be added to an Ionic application:
<pre>
- ionic cordova platform add android [iOS]
- ionic cordova platform rm android (to remove platform)
- ionic cordova build android (to build the required .apk file)
- ionic cordova run android (to run it on an AVD) or ionic serve --devapp (to run it with Ionic Devapp)

Notice: Cordova needs the Java JDK, Android SDK and Gradle for building an native application
(the paths should be added to the system environment variables).
